\title{Filter a bitset}
\usage{
filter_bitset(bitset, other)
}
\arguments{
\item{bitset}{the \code{\link{Bitset}} to filter}

\item{other}{the values to keep (may be a vector of integers, logicals, or
another \code{\link{Bitset}})}
}
\description{
This non-modifying function returns a new \code{\link{Bitset}}
object of the same maximum size as the original but which only contains
those values at the indices specified by the argument \code{other}.

Indices in \code{other} may be specified either as a vector of logicals, a
vector of integers or as another bitset. If a vector of logicals is
specified, it must be of the same size as the bitset. Please note that
filtering by another bitset is not a "bitwise and" intersection, and will
have the same behavior as providing an equivalent vector of integer indices.
